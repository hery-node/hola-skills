# Message Utilities (Removed)

> **⚠️ REMOVED**: The `hola-server/core/msg` module (WeChat Work messaging) has been removed from the framework.

If you need messaging functionality, integrate directly with your preferred messaging service (e.g., WeChat Work API, Slack, Discord, etc.) using their official SDKs.
